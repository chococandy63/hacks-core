This repository serves as a playground for these technologies and is intended for learning and exploration purposes.

## Hacks

- [ ]  backend agnostic host layer for wasm/webgpu with feature detection and webworkers module distribution
- [ ]  data model based on ECS and memory model based on Arrow.
- [ ]  store arrow dataframes on GPU
- [ ]  APIs for CPU and GPU compute on the guest side
- [ ]  implement webtransport based diff streaming
- [ ]  build virtual filesystem with OPFS and WASI
- [ ]  stick in wasm/webgpu devtools
- [ ]  build/research dataloader abstraction
- [ ]  package in cli/shell with shareable URLs for kernels
- [ ]  some compute kernels to showcase steaming compute
