## Hacks

- [ ]  Backend agnostic host layer for WASM/WebGPU with feature detection and Web Workers module distribution
- [ ]  Data model based on ECS and memory model based on Arrow
- [ ]  Store Arrow dataframes on GPU
- [ ]  APIs for CPU and GPU compute on the guest side
- [ ]  Implement WebTransport based diff streaming
- [ ]  Implement virtual filesystem layer with OPFS and WASI
- [ ]  Stick in WASM/WebGPU devtools
- [ ]  Build dataloader abstraction
- [ ]  Package in cli/shell with shareable URLs for kernels
- [ ]  Some compute kernels to showcase steaming compute
