This repository serves as a playground for these technologies and is intended for learning and exploration purposes.

## Hacks

- Throwaway CLI, built with clap and tokio, utilizes wasm_component_layer with wasmtime and web backends, as well as rust-gpu with a wgpu backend.
- Libraries, frameworks, and bundlers in the ecosystem to be integrated with Tilekit.
- Compute kernels: GPGPU code alongwith translators for CPU fallbacks.
- Apache Arrow memory model to study applicability in the context of yrs and blob data formats.
- First-class continuations in Wasmfx for CPU-GPU communication control flows in conjunction with wgpu.
- Wasm and WebGPU DevTools experiments.
- Experiments with libp2p and WebTransport.
